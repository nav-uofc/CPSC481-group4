In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, everyone is busy and there are few opportunities for spontaneous face to face interactions. Therefore, there is a market for an app to help students connect with study partners. Our application is intended to fill this niche: it will allow students to form or join study groups, rate and review peers, and collaborate through chat service. We intend for the platform we provide to aid any student in achieving academic success. The system will be accessed via a web browser from any computer/device with an internet connection. High school students, college/university students, and others can join and use the platform. </span></p><p class="c10 c15 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c31 title" id="h.sxtpekkjsnso"><span class="c0">Stakeholders</span></p><ol class="c25 lst-kix_3vgov6qewfni-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Ahmad Naveed Sorush</span><span class="c19 c23">: lead designer/programmer, project management, presentation, </span><span class="c19 c23">documentation</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">. </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Alyssa Tory</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: designer/programmer, documentation, main contact.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Erik Gottfred</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: user research, designer/programmer, testing, presentation, and mediation</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Jaewhan</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Yu</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: designer/programmer, presentation, documentation</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Kevin Wilson</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: designer/programmer, documentation</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Students: </span><span class="c13 c19 c27">Those interested in learning from or with others on our platform.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Tutors:</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">&nbsp;Those interested in using our platform in order to teach others.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Administrators:</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">&nbsp;Those responsible for maintenance and daily operation of the platform.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Educational Institutions</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: high schools, colleges and university are also stakeholders as this app can partner with them to help improve academic success</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Parents</span><span class="c13 c19 c27">: for younger students, parents who are interested in helping their children find good study peers can use the platform</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c4">Investors</span><span class="c19 c23">: any future investor would be a stakeholder in the app</span></li></ol><p class="c10 c11 c38"><span class="c36 c19 c27"></span></p><p class="c31 title" id="h.xr3k49c5spx"><span class="c0">Research</span></p><p class="c21 subtitle" id="h.25ocbpoa1cc0"><span class="c3">Survey</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c6">We chose to do an online survey as a way of gathering opinions from a wider variety of students than we would be able to talk to in person.

We included a timer, something you would set and it would run in your phone and encourage you to take (limited) breaks regularly. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">Jaewhan</span><span class="c19">:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Feature to connect with TAs or database of useful reference materials for courses would be nice to have.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">Alyssa</span><span class="c6">: So long as there&rsquo;s file sharing, group scheduling and messaging I think the essentials are covered.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">Naveed</span><span class="c6">: It would be really cool if this app integrated with Facebook and my university room finder so that I can find rooms via this app and book them. Maybe in the next version.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">Erik</span><span class="c6">: I think that the design may focus too much on students who are currently enrolled in actual university courses. There&rsquo;s almost certainly a market out there of learners who can&rsquo;t afford university, are studying something that&rsquo;s not available as a university course, can&rsquo;t fit the learning they want to do into their schedule, etc. Those hobbyists might be worth appealing to, even if they&rsquo;re not central to our user base. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c8">Kevin</span><span class="c6">: It could potentially be interesting to have an integrated feature for voice/video calls to have an online study session. </span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c13 c24">Interview Findings &amp; Reflection</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c6">The interview questions have helped us to better understand when a student may use the application and that even though not all people would be interested in using it there are a number of students who would. It has also taught us the potential good and bad things about the service as well as what could be added to make it better. There were no privacy/security concerns we have learned beyond what we already expected. The questions, however, seemed a bit too narrow and if we had asked more in depth questions we could have received information that would have given us a better starting point for starting to create the product. </span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c31 title" id="h.wu7r308y0k29"><span class="c0">Task Descriptions</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 1</span><span class="c6">: Student forming a study group</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c6">Lewys is a university student. He is very social and learns best in groups. Math 211 has been a bit difficult for him and the final exam is coming up. He has got together with two of his close friends taking the same course to study together, but there were still many parts that they weren&rsquo;t sure of. Lewys decides to form a larger study group for the final exam review so they could cover as much course material across as many people as possible. He creates a final exam review study group on the study group finder app. While setting up the group, he sets the institution to his university and sets the course to his math course. Finally, he gives several times slots for when he&rsquo;s available. A few hours later, he receives an email from the site informing him that someone has joined his group and matched with several of his time slots.</span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c17"></span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 2:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Student struggling and in need of help</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c6">Simon is a university student in the same math course as Lewys. He is currently struggling with the course and is behind on lots of course material. Final exam is approaching, and this is a course he cannot afford to fail. When he is stuck, he usually searches on the internet for answers but learning by himself from the internet takes some time and he is too far behind on the course to cover enough material before the final. He decides he needs a quicker way to learn and thinks about joining a study group. He searches his university and his math course on the study group finder app and sees that there is a final review group for his course. He decides to join the group. Once he joins, he selects the time slots already available that also work with his schedule.</span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 3:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Wants to join the group but time doesn&rsquo;t fit</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c6">Amy is a university student in the same math course as Lewys and Simon. She thinks she is doing well in the course but would like to compare her knowledge with other students in the same course to feel confident about her grasp of the course material. She thinks joining Lewys&rsquo; study group would be beneficial for her review of the course. However, the meeting times already suggested for Lewys&rsquo; group do not fit with her schedule. She joins the study group and sends a message in the group chat to negotiate an alternative meeting time with the group members.</span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 4:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Tutor new to the system, whose goal is to earn money</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c19">Harper is working many part time jobs but still needs extra cash. &nbsp;She decides tutoring high school students would be a good way to earn extra cash. She signs up on the study group finder app. Since she is new to the study group finder app, she doesn&rsquo;t have any ratings as a tutor on the app. &nbsp;Since this is her first time tutoring, her rating begins at </span><span class="c19">2.5</span><span class="c6">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10 c15 c11"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 5:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;High school student needing a tutor</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c19">Cynthia is a high school student. She wants to get into a certain university so getting good grades is important to her. She is looking for a tutor but cannot afford much. She talks to her friend Heather, another high school student who would like a tutor, and they use Cynthia&rsquo;s account on the study group finder to create a group. Cynthia sends Heather an invite to the group. Heather receives the invite via an email containing a link to the site. Heather does not have an account, so she is redirected to the sign up page, and creates one. There is a notification with Cynthia&rsquo;s invitation waiting for her. She accepts the invitation. Neither of them enjoy working in large groups, so Cynthia closes the group to other students. They decide to divide the payment equally between them, but since they still cannot afford to pay too much, they look for an inexpensive tutor. </span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c28">Task 6:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Parent looking for a tutor for their child</span></p><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c19">Nicholas is a parent who is very concerned with the education of his daughter Leanna, a junior high student. Leanna struggles to study on her own but is very introverted, has trouble making friends at school, and does not enjoy working in large groups. Nicholas creates an account in his daughter&rsquo;s name, using his own email, and searches the study group finder for small junior high level study groups with tutors. He finds an open group with a very highly rated tutor and applies to join it. The tutor receives an email notifying that another student has joined the open group.</span></p><p class="c10 c11"><span class="c17"></span></p>
